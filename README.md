# Bookstore Application

This repository contains the code for a Bookstore application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application allows users to manage a collection of books, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting book entries.

## Introduction

The **Bookstore Application** is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing books and their details. It includes a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js, and a frontend interface developed using React. MongoDB is used for scalable and flexible data storage.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, retrieve, update, and delete books.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive React-based UI for interacting with the book data.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API that follows REST principles for easy integration.
- **Scalable Storage**: Uses MongoDB for storing book data.
- **Authentication**: (Optional) User authentication and authorization.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing book information.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle server-side logic.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code execution.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests from React.
- **Nodemon**: Development tool for automatically restarting the server during code changes.
